Personal site. Static HTML, light CSS, a wee bit of JS. No frameworks, no build step, no pretense.

I use this to say who I am and what I care about. If you're here digging through the code, you're probably not the target audience—but hey, welcome.

## about me

I build things. Mostly systems, sometimes companies. I like hard problems, clean solutions, and tools that get out of the way.

I’ve spent over a decade in Costa Rica running U.S.-based businesses, solving logistics puzzles, and helping good people do better work.

I believe most things are figure-out-able. Simplicity scales. Bureaucracy doesn’t. And if something’s worth doing, it’s worth understanding first.

When I’m not working, I’m moving - planes, bikes, jungles, mountains.

This site is just a placeholder for everything I haven’t written yet.
