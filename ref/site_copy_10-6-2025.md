Hereâ€™s the full **updated site copy** incorporating your refined **hero descriptor** and messaging. Iâ€™ve kept the language lean, grounded, and in your voice. All sections now align with the *entrepreneur + strategic integrator* framing.

```md
# About

Most of my work starts in the early stagesâ€”when ideas are ambitious, timelines are tight, and structure doesnâ€™t exist yet.  
I learn fast, connect disciplines, and build systems that turn those ideas into something real.

My background is entrepreneurial. Iâ€™ve founded and run companies in travel, finance, property, and software. I understand early-stage chaos from the inside, which is why I often end up helping others navigate it too. My role usually isnâ€™t defined by a title. I step in early, see the whole picture, and help build whatâ€™s needed to get moving fast.

### Builder

I like shaping messy workflows into clear, durable systems. Sometimes thatâ€™s code. Sometimes itâ€™s financial structures or legal frameworks. Always itâ€™s about making things work smoothly.

### Strategist

I move between logistics, finance, and technology easily. I look for the real levers, the structural points that make a project stable and scalable.

### Operator

I build and run companies in real environments, not just on whiteboards. Tight deadlines, imperfect data, real stakes. I enjoy making things work under pressure and designing them to keep working when no oneâ€™s looking.

I live in Costa Rica. I split my time between running businesses, designing tools, and looking for the next interesting challenge.

```md
# Work

Iâ€™ve built and operated ventures in travel, finance, property, and software.  
In each case, the pattern is the same: start early, see the landscape quickly, and build the operational backbone that allows the work to scale.

## Already There Travel

Corporate travel management for large contractor deployments.  
We built clear systems to handle complex logistics at scale without losing flexibility.

**Focus:** group deployments, negotiated hotel rates, compliance, operational clarity  
**Role:** Co-founder, systems architect, operator

## PrestaMio / Native Capital

Private lending and mortgage financing in Costa Rica.  
We structure loans with strong collateral, clear legal frameworks, and disciplined underwritingâ€”designed to protect both borrowers and investors.

**Focus:** real estate-backed loans, power-of-attorney structures, cross-border finance  
**Role:** Founder, deal originator, structure designer

---

## Property & Development

I invest in and develop properties in Costa Rica. These range from container storefronts to vacation rentals.  
The focus is on practical, durable designs that work within local conditions.

**Focus:** adaptive design, legal clarity, financial discipline  
**Role:** Owner-operator

---

## Software & Tools

I build internal software to support my businesses: travel operations, loan tracking, property management, finance.  
Most of it started as something I needed quickly and grew from there.

## `projects.mdx` (Projects & Tools)

```md
# Projects & Tools

I build tools to solve real problemsâ€”usually my own. If they work well, I share them.  
Some are sharp and focused; some are rough but useful; some are experiments.

These tools reflect how I work: fast learning, cross-domain integration, and building practical structure quickly. Theyâ€™re part of how I turn ambitious ideas into working systems.

*(Project cards will go here.)*

---

### Why share them?

Because good tools travel well.  
Because someone else is usually facing a similar tangle.  
And because working in the open keeps things honest.

## `contact.mdx` (Contact)

```md
# Contact

If something here resonates, reach out.

The best conversations usually start with a real project, a sharp question, or a clear idea.  
Iâ€™m not interested in vague pitches or bulk solicitations.
