InstructiFly started as a fast prototype for a flight academy that needed to modernize its curriculum. They had great instructors and aircraft, but no real system for tracking lesson plans, stage checks, or compliance requirements.

I built a modular curriculum designer where instructors can remix lesson blocks, assign pre-work, and log time in a unified system. Under the hood it ties into FAA templates, currency tracking, and a skill proficiency matrix that exposes gaps automatically.

The next phase is a shared marketplace for specialized instruction. Think tailwheel, floatplane, or instrument refreshers. The marketplace runs on top of the same curriculum blocks, so adding a new course is mostly configuration.

The prototype now powers a small cohort of pilots in training. Weâ€™re refining the instructor tools, adding analytics for training managers, and tightening how the system exports to existing ops software.
