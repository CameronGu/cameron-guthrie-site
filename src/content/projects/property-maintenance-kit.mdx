Maintaining rental properties across Costa Rica means different climates, suppliers, and maintenance crews. We needed a way to standardize how every property is inspected, cleaned, and restocked without flying blind.

The Property Maintenance Kit is a lightweight web and mobile experience that gives caretakers a structured checklist and real-time inventory tracking. Each property has a seasonal plan—filters, linens, consumables, and long-lead items—so nothing is forgotten.

The system ties into WhatsApp for quick status updates, runs nightly syncs to our inventory spreadsheet, and alerts me before we hit low stock thresholds. It cut last-minute supply runs by 60% and keeps guests from finding surprises.

The next iteration will include a vendor marketplace and cost benchmarking so we can negotiate better rates collectively.
