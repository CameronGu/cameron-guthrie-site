Radar Briefing started as a private memo I wrote for teams across my portfolio. Everyone needed to know how macro shifts—fuel prices, airline capacity, regional regulations—would affect ops.

Now it’s becoming a structured publication and data product. Each briefing pulls in data, highlights the strategic implications, and suggests actions. It’s half operational intelligence, half accountability tracker.

The current version is built in Astro with MDX content, a curated data pipeline, and automations that push highlights to Slack or email depending on urgency.

Long term, Radar Briefing will power a live dashboard that flags leading indicators and assigns owners to follow-up tasks.
