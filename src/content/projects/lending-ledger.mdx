Private lending in Costa Rica means dealing with multiple currencies, shifting collateral valuations, and legal structures that require precise documentation. Off-the-shelf options don’t support the way we structure deals.

Lending Ledger is an internal system that tracks every loan from origination to payoff. It generates power-of-attorney packages, monitors collateral coverage, and produces investor statements automatically. The CLI portion handles quick-look risk checks when we’re evaluating new deals on the go.

Every loan and collateral record syncs to a cloud document store with notarized PDFs, so any partner can audit the portfolio at a moment’s notice. Default scenarios trigger automated legal workflows, cutting days off the response time.

It’s built in TypeScript with a Postgres core and a set of small services for document generation and payment tracking. The goal is clarity: every stakeholder should know, at a glance, the state of the book and the actions required.
