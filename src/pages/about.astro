        About
      </h1>
      <p class="max-w-3xl text-lg text-muted">
        Most of my work starts in the early stages—when ideas are ambitious, timelines are tight,
        and structure doesn’t exist yet. I learn fast, connect disciplines, and build systems that
        turn those ideas into something real.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-3xl text-lg text-muted">
        My background is entrepreneurial. I’ve founded and run companies in travel, finance, property,
        and software. I understand early-stage chaos from the inside, which is why I often end up
        helping others navigate it too. My role usually isn’t defined by a title. I step in early,
        see the whole picture, and help build what’s needed to get moving fast.

          I like shaping messy workflows into clear, durable systems. Sometimes that’s code.
          Sometimes it’s financial structures or legal frameworks. Always it’s about making things
          work smoothly.

          I move between logistics, finance, and technology easily. I look for the real levers,
          the structural points that make a project stable and scalable.

          I build and run companies in real environments, not just on whiteboards. Tight deadlines,
          imperfect data, real stakes. I enjoy making things work under pressure and designing them
          to keep working when no one’s looking.

        I live in Costa Rica. I split my time between running businesses, designing tools, and
        looking for the next interesting challenge.
